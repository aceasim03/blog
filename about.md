# About Me

Hi — I’m [Ace Asim].  
I’m a graduate student working at the intersection of **AI ethics, culture, and the lived experiences that shape how we understand technology**.

I think about technology not only as a system of algorithms and infrastructures, but also as something deeply human:
how it feels, how it shows up in our cities, how it shapes our psychology, and how we move through the world with it.

My background spans:

- **AI ethics & governance**  
- **Philosophy, culture, and political theory**  
- **Art, design, and the emotional experience of technology**  
- **Travel, urban spaces, and fieldnotes from places I live or visit**

This blog is where all of those threads meet.

## 🌍 What This Blog Is

This is a space for:

- essays on **AI ethics**, **surveillance**, and **algorithmic culture**  
- reflections on **art**, **cities**, and **architecture**  
- travel notes from wherever I am  
- questions I’m thinking through  
- moments that become ideas, and ideas that return as feelings  

I write here to explore, to document, and to stay honest about the human side of this work.

## 🧭 Elsewhere

- My research interests include:  
  AI governance, philosophy of technology, cultural interpretation of tech, media theory, urban sociology, and ethics of automation.

- I’m particularly interested in **how different societies understand AI**,  
  and how culture shapes our perception of “risk,” “progress,” and “the good life.”
