> “Community is not built by programs; it is built by people who choose to show up.”

There is a quiet magic to Thursday nights at Yenching Academy.

Before the first chord rings out, there is a soft hum in Erti — students drifting in from the cold, someone tuning a guitar, another warming their hands around a cup of tea. It looks simple. Informal. Unstructured. Yet it has become one of the most meaningful spaces on campus: a weekly ritual of warmth in an academically demanding environment.

Music Night reminds us that community is built not through grand events, but through repeated small acts of showing up.

## The YCA Live Showcase: A Spark, Not a Finale

When we hosted the YCA Live Showcase, the stage lights and packed audience created a surreal, electric energy. It felt like a major event — a celebration of student talent — but in retrospect, its significance was deeper.

The Showcase revealed what already existed beneath the surface:  
creativity, vulnerability, courage, and a hunger for connection.

It showed that art at YCA isn’t something students do *outside* their academic lives. It’s woven into how they think, feel, and relate to one another.

Music Night is where that spark becomes a steady flame.

## Music Night: Community in Its Most Human Form

Weekly Music Night is softer, quieter, and more intimate than the Showcase. No spotlight. No pressure. No performance expectations.

Just:

- people who want to sing  
- people who want to listen  
- people who want to sit in a warm room after a long week  

Music Night blurs boundaries between disciplines and cultures. It dissolves academic stress. It turns strangers into collaborators and listeners into friends. In these unpolished, unguarded moments, true community takes shape.

It is a space where the human side of graduate school can breathe.

# Arts and Academics: Why They Belong Together

One of the clearest insights from Music Night is that the arts nourish academic life. At an interdisciplinary program like Yenching, the connection between creativity and scholarship is not accidental — it is essential.

### 1. Art is a form of knowledge  
A song carries emotion, memory, cultural history, and lived experience. These are not "extras" to academic study; they deepen it.

Art shows us how governance, policy, and society feel at the human level.

### 2. Creativity supports intellectual work  
Graduate research requires imagination, flexibility, and resilience. Music loosens the rigid academic mind, making space for new ideas and new connections.

Creativity is not a break from scholarship — it is a companion to it.

### 3. The arts sustain wellbeing  
The pace of YCA is intense: seminars, readings, research, language study, travel. Music Night functions as a weekly reset, allowing students to decompress and return to their work with more energy and perspective.

Emotional wellbeing is part of academic success.

### 4. Cross-cultural exchange happens naturally through art  
In a community of international and Chinese scholars, genuine understanding is not created through readings alone. It happens when someone shares a song from home, explains a lyric, or teaches a melody they grew up with.

This is where cultural understanding becomes lived rather than theorized.

### 5. Art strengthens our ethical imagination  
For those of us studying AI ethics, law, governance, and social systems, it is easy to forget that ethical reasoning requires imagination and empathy. Music expands emotional literacy and helps cultivate the sensitivity needed to think ethically about technology and society.

Art reminds us what we are trying to protect when we talk about “ethics.”

## Reuniting with Prof. Andrew Field

This week, something special happened: my former mentor and co-host from Duke, Professor Andrew Field, joined Music Night after giving a film screening. Standing beside him again — this time in Beijing — felt like a bridge between past and present.

It reminded me that community-building is portable.  
The skills, the energy, and the intention travel with you.  
They take root again in new soil.

Music Night at YCA now carries a piece of that earlier life in Kunshan, transformed into something new for a new community.

## What Music Night Means for YCA

If the Showcase was the spark, Music Night is the steady flame.

My hope is that it continues to grow as:

- a cultural crossroads  
- a weekly ritual of comfort  
- a space for emotional and creative expression  
- a quiet reminder that we are more than our research  

At YCA, where we study society, culture, law, ethics, governance, and technology, the arts provide grounding. They shape not only how we think but who we become.

Music Night is a reminder that academic life is not only about producing ideas — it is also about sustaining the human spirit behind those ideas.
